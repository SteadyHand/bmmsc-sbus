My Virtual Examâ„¢ S.BUS driver for the Blackmagic Micro Studio Camera (4K). And likely all other Blackmagic cameras that support S.BUS.Install:In /usr/src download and install the ftd2xx library:https://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htmWhich will create shared libraries in /usr/local/libClone this repository as well to /usr/src/ftdi/examplesRun makeCreate a directory e.g. /opt/ctrlCopy sbus and sbus.ini to /opt/ctrlCopy sbus.service to /usr/lib/systemd/systemIn mve.ini you can set the device's serial number. A delay less than 5ms causes the camera to blackout.systemctl start/stop/restart sbusOn exit, last channel data is saved to sbus.save and loaded upon startYou need a UART that supports a custom devider like the FTDI FT232 USB to TTL converter with the TX inverted.Execute ./read n where n is the ID of the device, default 0./write nWhich will write a serial number "MVE" to the device and inverts the TX pin.Connect TX to the white and GND to the red wire.; Channel definitions; [0]=single position switch; [1]=toggle up/down where n=1 or -1; [2]=range where [9] the number of steps; [3]=bit 1/0 for e.g. channel 18 reset; Examples:; 'echo "18" > /dev/shm/sbus' resets the camera settings; 'echo "2 4" > /dev/shm/sbus' sets the aperture to f4channel1 = [0]                  ; On/Off trigger for REC start/stopchannel2 = [2][9]               ; Irischannel3 = [2][9]               ; Focuschannel4 = [0]                  ; Auto Focuschannel5 = [2][9]               ; Zoomchannel6 = [1]                  ; Gainchannel7 = [1]                  ; Shutter Speedchannel8 = [1]                  ; White Balancechannel9 = [1]                  ; Audio Levelschannel10 = [2][9]              ; Frame Ratechannel18 = [3]                 ; Reset shutter speed, gain and white balance

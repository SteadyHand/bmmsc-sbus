Install:Create directory /opt/ctrlCopy sbus and sbus.ini to /opt/ctrlCopy sbus.service to /usr/lib/systemd/systemsystemctl start/stop/restart sbusLast channel data is saved to sbus.save and loaded upon startYou need a UART that supports a custom devider like the FTDI FT232With the FT232 use FT_Prog and invert TXOr use a 2N7000 transistor and a 2k2 to 3k3 resistor to invert the signalFlat side transistor to the front:pin 1= groundpin 2= signal TX from UARTpin 3= S.BUS out with the resistor connected to 5V
